# Visualization

## Readings

- [AI is Blurring the Definition of Artist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/ai-is-blurring-the-definition-of-artist)
- [Timeline of AI Art](https://aiartists.org/ai-timeline-art)

## Preparing

This week we are going to talk about AI art.

The first article lays the groundwork of what AI art is and what some of the big questions are. The second is a collection of the significant milestones in AI art over the years. Start by reading through those two sources.

Then I want you to pick an artist from this list: [Founding members of AIArtists.org](https://aiartists.org/ai-artist-founding-members). Read the profile and be able to answer these questions (you may need to do some digging beyond the profile pages):

- In what way is AI incorporated in the artist's work?
- Is the AI being used as a tool, a collaborator, or is it the primary artist?

On top of that, I want you to think about some more broad (and to a great extent, subjective) questions:

- Can AI be creative?
- What is the role of "intent" in AI artwork?
- Is it art?

## General Prompts

- something you didn’t understand, or want to know more about
- something that surprised you — something you hadn’t thought of before or didn’t know existed
- something that resonated with you — you recognize it in your own interactions with technology
- something you disagree with
- something you are concerned about
