# Visualization

## Readings

- [Data Visualization’s Breakthrough Moment in the COVID-19 Crisis](https://medium.com/nightingale/data-visualizations-breakthrough-moment-in-the-covid-19-crisis-ce46627c7db5)

## Preparing

This week, we are going to do something a little bit different. I've given you one article to read about the role of visualization during the pandemic. I want you to think critically about it, as we have previous readings using our collection of prompts.

In addition, I would like you to bring a visualization to share. The visualization can be on any topic, it just needs to be interesting to you on some way. Some possibilities:

- the topic is meaningful, and the visualization illustrates it well
- the visualization is a useful tool for understanding something
- the visualization is visually arresting or aesthetic
- the visualization seems to be lying in some way
- the visualization is incomprehensible

You can find visualizations all over the place these days. Practically every story about the pandemic or the election includes a visualization. I particularly recommend checking out the [Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) on the New York Times, which has a long history now of mixing visualizations and journalism.

Make sure you have a URL ready.

## General Prompts

- something you didn’t understand, or want to know more about
- something that surprised you — something you hadn’t thought of before or didn’t know existed
- something that resonated with you — you recognize it in your own interactions with technology
- something you disagree with
- something you are concerned about
