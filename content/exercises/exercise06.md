#### Goals

- Gain some experience breaking down a problem

## Prerequisite

There is no starter code for this exercise, so go ahead and visit <https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html> and make sure you are logged in.

## Objective

In this exercise, you are going to do your own deconstruction to try to make your own copy of one of Waclaw Szpakowski's works.

Your goal is to get the sprite to draw this image:

![Szpakowski image](../images/exercises/exercise06/waclaw-szpakowski-11.jpg)

## The approach

Try to emulate the process you watched me go through

- Look for repeating patterns. Notice that in his drawing you can usually identify there are layers of repetition -- there are usually small motifs that repeat to make up larger motifs, which themselves are repeated.
- Identify a common size that you can use as a relative measure for the shapes (i.e., many shapes are multiples of the size)
- Write blocks to encapsulate repeating patterns

## Collaboration

For this exercise, we will work collaboratively. Pair up with someone near you.

Start by talking through your observations and working with pen and paper. Don't start coding until you have a solid idea of what you are going to do.

#### What I will be looking for

- When the user clicks the ![green flag](../images/snap-icons/green-flag-button.png#inline), the above drawing should be drawn
- The drawing should be sized proportionally and fit on the stage
- A variable should be used to control the size of the drawing
- I should see some use of abstraction -- a repeating pattern should recognized and used in a custom block

## Submitting

Share the project using the instructions from [exercise 1](exercise01).
