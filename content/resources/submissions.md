For all of your exercises and assignments, you will be submitting your work through Canvas. Your submissions will consist of **two** files: an XML file containing your Snap! project and a text file containing a reflection on your work. When you make your submission, it is important to submit both files at the same time. If you submit only one file, the next submission will be a resubmit that overwrites the first one. If you make a mistake in your submission, please resubmit both files.

## Snap! Project

To download your program, you need to export it.

Return to the ![file button](../images/snap-icons/file-button.png#inline) menu.

Select "Export project...".

If you have already saved the project, it should download immediately. If you have not yet saved the project, you will be asked for a name. A dialog will pop up asking you to name the project. Name the project with either "exercise" or "assignment" followed by the two digit number of the exercise or assignment (e.g., "exercise01" or "assignment01").

## Reflection

For the reflection, Copy this template into a text file and fill it out.

```plaintext
Have all requirements been met?


If not, what is missing or not working?



What did you learn from this exercise or assignment?


What do you still find confusing or difficult?
```

## Resubmitting

You may resubmit your work as often as you like.

If you resubmit before the due date, the last submission will be the one that is assessed.

If you resubmit after the due date, please add a **dated** note at the end that says what you have changed.
