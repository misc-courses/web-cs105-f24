Every week you will submit a short reflection looking back over the week in the class.

I expect reflections to be relatively terse (bullet-pointed lists are fine), though if you have more to say, by all means, go ahead. I will read these and use them to shape the class for the coming week, however, my goal is for these to primarily be for you. They should help you be more mindful about what you are getting out of the class, as well as providing a record for you to revisit at the end to look at your progress.

As one of their roles is to inform the shape of the class, these should be completed each week **after the Friday class** and **by the start of class on the following Monday**.
