#### Goals

- Demonstrate your ability to deconstruct a problem
- Demonstrate your ability to apply abstraction to problem solving

## Task

For this assignment, I would like you to spend a little more time hanging out with Wac≈Çaw Szpakowski.

This time I would like you to write a block that produces this image:

![Szpakowski image](../images/assignments/assignment03/waclaw-szpakowski-04.jpg)

The block should take one input. That input will be the overall length of the completed image. Note that this is different from the value we used to drive our other explorations, which was the size of some basic unit. This time you will need to reverse engineer any base unit distance you use for constructing the elements of the image.

You should write _at least one_ additional block which draws one of the repeating motifs in the image. (More than a single additional block is, of course, just fine)

#### Expectations

- You should create a block that draws the above image
- Its one input should determine the overall length of the figure
- There should be at least one additional custom block which is used repeatedly to draw a repeated motif
