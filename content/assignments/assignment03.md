#### Goals

- Demonstrate your ability to deconstruct a problem
- Demonstrate your ability to apply abstraction to problem solving

## Task

For this assignment, I would like you to spend a little more time hanging out with Wac≈Çaw Szpakowski.

This time I would like you to write a block that produces this image:

![Szpakowski image](../images/assignments/assignment03/waclaw-szpakowski-04.jpg)

The block should take one input. That input will be the overall length of the completed image. Note that this is different from the value we used to drive our other explorations, which was the size of some basic unit. This time you will need to reverse engineer any base unit distance you use for constructing the elements of the image.

You should write _at least one_ additional block which draws one of the repeating motifs in the image. (More than a single additional block is, of course, just fine)

#### Expectations

- You should create a block that draws the above image
- Its one input should determine the overall length of the figure
- There should be at least one additional custom block which is used repeatedly to draw a repeated motif

## Reflection

I would like you to write a short reflection about your process of completing the assignment. The reflection should be embedded in your project as a comment. To make a comment, right click in the script area of the Snap! editor. A context menu should pop up and give you the option to 'add comment'. Create a separate comment for each piece of the assignment.

Each reflection should contain the following things:

- If the block or script currently doesn't work, a description of what is not working and what you have tried to do to fix it
- If the block or script is working, a description of what was the hardest part to accomplish
- A description of what help you received to accomplish each piece
- A description of what you learned
- Your assessment of your ability to repeat this work later completely independently
